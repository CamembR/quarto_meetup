[Many Data scientists <br> use Jupyter <br> ðŸ˜¬]{.larger}

::: notes
Many data scientists use python and jupyter notebooks. And my role is not to learn python from the ground-up, but I needed to be able to collaborate with and support python users.

Transition: But I also brought over 6 years of experience and confidence that I've developed using RMarkdown. I think of RMarkdown like a superpower

And Quarto let me bring this superpower to python.

::: notes
Quarto enables collaborating across coding languages. This is a simplified view of the yaml it's collection of different file types. It's mostly ipynbs Jupyter notebooks.

And, as we work with more research teams we've found that there is indeed a substantial R community using NASA Earthdata Cloud data. And we're positioned to support R users too

::: notes
we're all able to contribute from whatever tool we're already comfortable with. In our group some use RStudio, some use JupyterLab some VS Code, some directly edit documents on GitHub.

And this was important because of all the new things we were learning together, we didn't also need people to shift their software tools.

transtion: Let me show you how to use Quarto with Jupyter with ipynb notebooks

##  {#demo-collaborate .center data-menu-title="Demo: Collaborate" background-video="videos/make_website.mp4" background-size="contain" background-color="#FFFFFF"}

::: notes
-   Orient to JupyterLab. This is a JupyterHub managed by our collaborators at 2i2c
-   Open Mine's example site, quarto preview
-   add .ipynb
-   Add `.ipynb` to `_quarto.yml`
-   View website - new page is added to website
-   Add fig captions
-   margin plots: a style preferred by many now in jupyter notebook
