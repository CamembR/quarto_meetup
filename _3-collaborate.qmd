[Many Data scientists <br> use Python <br> ðŸ˜¬]{.larger}

::: notes
Many data scientists use python and jupyter notebooks. And my role is not to learn python from the ground-up, but I needed to be able to collaborate with and support python users.

Transition: But I also brought over 6 years of experience and confidence that I've developed using RMarkdown. I think of RMarkdown like a superpower

:::

::: notes
This Quarto site we made for our first teaching event. 

This is where we really found traction in working together as a Mentor community: we were able to make a beautiful collection of tutorials that was helpful for our own development and was a friendly place for our learners.

Quarto was also something for us all to learn together. And that was really important bc it turned out I wasn't the only person feeling intimidated about all the moving parts. We were able to identify other skills to learn together.

So from this investment in our workflow and learning  -

::: notes
Quarto enables collaborating across coding languages. This is a simplified view of the yaml it's collection of different file types. It's mostly ipynbs Jupyter notebooks.

And, as we work with more research teams we've found that there is indeed a substantial R community using NASA Earthdata Cloud data. And we're positioned to support R users too

::: notes
we're all able to contribute from whatever tool we're already comfortable with. In our group some use RStudio, some use JupyterLab some VS Code, some directly edit documents on GitHub.

And this was important because of all the new things we were learning together, we didn't also need people to shift their software tools.

transtion: Let me show you how to use Quarto with Jupyter with ipynb notebooks

::: notes
-   Orient to JupyterLab. This is a JupyterHub managed by our collaborators at 2i2c
-   Open Mine's example site, quarto preview
- add .ipynb 
-   Add `.ipynb` to `_quarto.yml`
-   View website - new page is added to website
-  Add fig captions
- margin plots: a style preferred by many now in jupyter notebook
