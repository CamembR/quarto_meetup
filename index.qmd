But also, we know you have questions. We did too. What is Quarto? Why is Quarto? And how does it relate to R Markdown and the workflows you already have?

--\> Well

::: notes
It unifies it for people who love R Markdown by reducing little points of friction, so that websites, books, and slides all have a common approach.

And it extends it for people who don't know RMarkdown by being a friendly way to work reproducibly and publish documents that have text and code in the same place

The goal is to make the process of creating and collaborating dramatically better.

# Thank you {.title-top-dark background-image="images/horst_quarto_penguins_thankyou.png"}

::: notes
Thank you so much for joining us this morning, here in person or from wherever you are tuning in to the live stream. We've talked about our experiences using Quarto and all the problems it has helped us solve and reimagine, but while Quarto is stable and ready for use, it's also a baby that you too can be a part of its growth. So start using Quarto, and get involved by asking questions, reporting issues, providing feedback, and even building extensions for it. We can't wait to see what you create!
